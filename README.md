## FITNESS TRACKER MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
This fitness tracker is designed to classify different exercises performed during a workout session using machine learning techniques. The tracker can identify the following exercises: bench press, deadlift, row,  squat, overhead press,and also detect rest periods when the user is not performing any exercise.

## Achieving Smarter Workouts with AI-Powered Fitness Exercise Tracker
Enhancing workout efficiency with real-time exercise classification and rest period detection.
## Project Overview
__Client:__ Fitness Enthusiasts & Athletes
__Industry:__ Health & Fitness
__Technology Used:__ Machine Learning, Wearable Sensors
__Results:__
1. Automated classification of bench press, deadlift, row, squat, and overhead press
2. Accurate detection of rest periods to optimize workout routines
3. Improved workout tracking and performance insights
## The Problem/Goal
Fitness enthusiasts often struggle to track and analyze their workouts effectively. Manual
logging is tedious, and traditional fitness trackers fail to accurately classify different exercises.
Additionally, users lack real-time feedback on their form, rep counts, and rest periods, making it
challenging to optimize performance and recovery.
