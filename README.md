<p align="center"> This fitness tracker is designed to classify different exercises performed during a workout session using machine learning techniques. The tracker can identify the following exercises: bench press, deadlift, row,  squat, overhead press,and also detect rest periods when the user is not performing any exercise.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The fitness tracker leverage the power of machine learning techniques to classify various excercises the users is performing at various point in time.The core functionality of our model lies in its ability to recognize and categorize various exercises, including bench press, deadlift, row, squat, overhead press. This comprehensive exercise repertoire ensures that users can track their entire workout routine effortlessly.

## Data
The model was trained with both accelerometer and gyroscope data collected over a period of time with five different participants performing  all the various excercises both medium and heavy sets using the sensors in a fitness watch.

### gyrocsope data:
- epoch (ms) : unix time
- time (01:00) : datetime
- elapsed (s) : duration
- x-axis (deg/s) : horizontal axis
- y-axis (deg/s) : vertical axis
- z-axis (deg/s) : depth

### accelerometer data:
- epoch (ms) : unix time
- time (01:00) : datetime
- elapsed (s) : duration
- x-axis (g) : horizontal axis 
- y-axis (g) : vertical axis
- z-axis (g) :depth
